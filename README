What is ... ?

You want a simple web server started in a directory for dev or whatever, so you
could use good ol' `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` but you are busy and you don't
care about the port but UGH you have to pick a port and maybe it collides with
the server you're already running on 8000? but OMG picking ports is so hard I
don't CARE can't someone just do it for me why yes someone can! It's your
operating system, if you ask to listen a socket on port 0 then it will assign
one for you from its vast array of 16-bit uints. Oh and then of course you don't
want to mouse over to the URL and copy/paste it like a peasant so hey,
quickserver will open it FOR YOU in your browser thanks you're welcome.

Requirements:

 * Python 2.5 or greater. Works with Py3k.

Usage:

    $ ./quickserver
    Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 61209 ...
    http://0.0.0.0:61209/
    127.0.0.1 - - [19/Jun/2014 17:21:56] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 -
